        Base API for all table actions

        This abstraction defining the base API for all table actions.  This allows
        function routers to handle all types of actions for each table
        implementation.

        Lambda Handler event will issue a command to the DB and will route the
        command to the specific table implementation.

        Commands are similar to:

            - item:get
            - item:list
            - item:create
            - item:update

            or

            - event:create
            - event:get
            - event:list

        Where the lambda event.action split(":")[0] is the table short name and the item after
        the colon is the action to perform. (Class method)
