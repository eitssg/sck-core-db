# Platform Deployment Actions

This directory contains CloudFormation templates and deployment action files for the SCK Core DB platform resources.

## Overview

Action files follow the naming convention `<task>.actions` where `<task>` represents a specific deployment lifecycle stage.

## Available Tasks

### CI/CD Pipeline Tasks
* **package** - Package application artifacts and dependencies
* **upload** - Upload packaged artifacts to storage (S3, artifact repositories)
* **compile** - Compile source code and generate build artifacts

### Infrastructure Tasks
* **plan** - Generate and review infrastructure change plans
* **apply** - Apply infrastructure changes to target environment
* **deploy** - Deploy application code and configurations
* **release** - Promote builds through environments and mark as released

### Cleanup Tasks
* **teardown** - Remove infrastructure and clean up resources

## Usage Notes

- **CI/CD Tasks**: `package`, `upload`, and `compile` are typically executed by CLI/API tools and do not directly invoke deployment actions
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: `plan`, `apply`, `deploy`, and `release` interact with cloud infrastructure
- **Cleanup Tasks**: `teardown` should be used carefully as it removes deployed resources

## CloudFormation Templates

This directory contains the following CloudFormation templates:

- `core-automation-db-facts.yaml` - Registry tables for client, portfolio, app, and zone facts
- `core-automation-db-items.yaml` - Item and event tables with associated Lambda triggers

## Getting Started

1. Review the available action files for your deployment task
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the target environment
3. Execute actions in the appropriate order for your use case
4. Monitor deployment progress through the provided logging and feedback mechanisms
