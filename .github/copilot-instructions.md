# Copilot Instructions (Submodule: sck-core-db)

- Tech: Python package (DB helpers).
- Precedence: Local first; then root at `../../.github/...`.
- Conventions: Follow `../sck-core-ui/docs/backend-code-style.md` for shared patterns.

## Contradiction Detection
- Validate against backend patterns and root precedence.
- On conflict, warn + options + example.
- Example: "Suggesting unbounded scans conflicts with performance guidance; require pagination/indices and limits."
